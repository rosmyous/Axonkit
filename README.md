    "fmt"

    "github.com/axonkit/toolkit/go"
)

type HelloWorldTool struct{}

func (h *HelloWorldTool) Execute(ctx context.Context, input json.RawMessage) (json.RawMessage, error) {
    return json.RawMessage(`{"message":"Hello, World!"}`), nil
}

func (h *HelloWorldTool) Schema() (string, string) {
    return "{}", "{\"message\":\"string\"}"
}

func main() {
    manager := toolkit.NewToolManager()

    helloTool := &HelloWorldTool{}
    manager.RegisterTool("hello", helloTool)

    input := json.RawMessage(`{}`)
    output, err := manager.ExecuteTool("hello", context.Background(), input)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Output:", string(output))
}
```
